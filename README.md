# A scheduling pipeline for rapid experimentation in Kubernetes

This repository contains starter code for creating scheduling pipelines to run code on a Kubernetes cluster.
The .yaml template file is just that: a template giving you an idea about what you can automate within a scheduling pipeline.
When cloning the project, be creative and adjust it to your needs.
